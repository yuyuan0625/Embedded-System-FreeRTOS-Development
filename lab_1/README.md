# Lab1: MultiTask, with Inter-Task Communication (ITC) mechanism
## Requirements
- Two Tasks: **LED-task** and **Button-task**
- **LED-task** will have two states (S1, S2)
    - S1: First, the Red LED lights up for 1 second, followed by the Orange LED
lighting up for 1 second (with the Red LED turned off), then the Green LED
lights up for 1 second (with both the Red and Orange LEDs turned off). This
sequence repeats, cycling through the Red, Orange, and Green LEDs.
    - S2: Only Orange LED is blinking (2 second ON, 2 second OFF, …)
- **Button-task**: If the button is pressed, the LED-task will switch to another state
(S1→S2).
    - **Debounce handling**
    - Edge detection handling
